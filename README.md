![Build status](https://app.travis-ci.com/EdoardoMolinatti/DeckOfCards.svg?branch=main)

A program representing a deck of playing cards, customizable (the basic version has the classic 52 cards in four suits).

You can **shuffle** the cards as many times as you want, making random swaps between the cards in the deck.
